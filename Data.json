								"body": "\"Sustainability\" is about finding ways to meet our needs in the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  It's a single term that encompasses a range of technical and social challenges—and also the opportunities we create—to improve the quality of our lives and those who will follow after us.  Explore this panel to discover more about how supercomputers play an important part in creating a sustainable future. ",
